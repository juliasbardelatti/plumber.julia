```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The code here creates a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) application that
interacts with the cars model R object. This can be used in connection with the 
[other app](../api-app) to showcase how a Shiny application can be updated to 
use a Plumber API.
